# Automated Web Testing with Selenium and .NET

It is a simple web application and  test scripts to automate testing of its functionalities.

## Installation


```bash
cd SeleniumTests
dotnet add package Selenium.WebDriver
dotnet add package Selenium.WebDriver.ChromeDriver
```

## Run

Open two different terminals

In one terminal -

```
cd SimpleWebApp
dotnet run
```

In other terminal -

```
cd SeleniumTests
dotnet run
```

## Tests
 
1. Verify that the web page loads successfully. 
2. Enter the name, email and phone in the input fields and submit the form. 
3. Do not enter the optional fields and submit the form. 
4. Verify that the welcome message is displayed correctly with the entered name. 
5. In some cases, the welcome message could be displayed after some background 
processing (simulate a delay of 3 seconds). The test script should wait for the welcome 
message to be displayed and then verify it.
